 * @param command_line Command line. Will be converted to its UTF-16 equivalent.
 * @param process_attributes Same as CreateProcess.

 * @param n_inherit_handles Number of handles the child process will inherit.
 * @param inherit_handles Handles the child process will inherit.
 * @param creation_flags Will be ORed with CREATE_SUSPENDED|CREATE_BREAKAWAY_FROM_JOB.

 * @param current_directory Current directory. Will be converted to its UTF-16 equivalent or NULL.

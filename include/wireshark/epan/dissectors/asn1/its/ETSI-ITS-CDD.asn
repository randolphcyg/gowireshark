 * This DE indicates the acceleration confidence value which represents the estimated absolute accuracy of an acceleration value with a default confidence level of 95 %.
 * If required, the confidence level can be defined by the corresponding standards applying this DE.
 *
 * The value shall be set to:
 * - `n` (`n > 0` and `n < 101`) if the confidence value is equal to or less than n x 0,1 m/s^2, and greater than (n-1) x 0,1 m/s^2,
 * - `101` if the confidence value is out of range i.e. greater than 10 m/s^2,
 * - `102` if the confidence value is unavailable.ProtocolVersion
 *
 * The value 0 shall not be used.
 *
 * @note: The fact that an acceleration value is received with confidence value set to `unavailable(102)` can be caused by several reasons, such as:
 * - the sensor cannot deliver the accuracy at the defined confidence level because it is a low-end sensor,
 * - the sensor cannot calculate the accuracy due to lack of variables, or
 * - there has been a vehicle bus (e.g. CAN bus) error.
 * In all 3 cases above, the acceleration value may be valid and used by the application.
 *
 * @note: If an acceleration value is received and its confidence value is set to `outOfRange(101)`, it means that the value is not valid and therefore cannot be trusted. Such value is not useful for the application.

 * - the sensor cannot deliver the accuracy at the defined confidence level because it is a low-end sensor,
 * - the sensor cannot calculate the accuracy due to lack of variables, or

 * In all 3 cases above, the curvature value may be valid and used by the application.
 *
 * @note: If a curvature value is received and its confidence value is set to `outOfRange(6)`, it means that the curvature value is not valid

 * the position is counted from the legal (i.e. optical) separation between traffic directions (horizontal marking).
 *
 * If not indicated otherwise (by lane markings or traffic signs), the legal separation on carriageways allowing traffic on both directions is identified as follows:
 * - If the total number of lanes N is even, the lanes are divided evenly between the traffic directions starting from the outside of the carriageway on both sides and the

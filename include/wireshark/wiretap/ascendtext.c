   This module reads the text hex dump output of various TAOS

   * pridisplay         traces primary rate ISDN
   * ether-display      traces Ethernet packets (dangerous! CPU intensive)
   * wanopening, wandisplay, wannext, wandsess
                        traces PPP or other WAN connections

   Please see ascend_parser.lemon for examples.
